# AutoWaveShaper

Pixelbased autoplay for WAVESHAPER
WIP

Key emulation is done through WinForms->SendKeys (which is basically a wrapper for user32 SendInput). 

Currently works but not flawlessly, it makes some mistakes.

ToDo: 
- More reliable pixel detection
- Better logic when detecting shapes
- Implement a custom SendInput logic to emulate keyboard
